    <img src="infinite.jpg" alt="Image from FFX">

    <p class="large,blue">Amazon dropped this gem on the 10th of June last year. The concept of this movie love it. To be reicarnated and remember your past lives. Even though remembering all of your deaths, is pretty sour.So the two fractions of the recarnations are Belivers and the Nihilists. Both fractions are tryin to find this egg that the hero Evan hid in his past life. The belivers want to destroy the egg because it can destroy the world and end life on earth, whereas the Nihilists want to do the opposite and stop the recarnation process for good, reliving the memories is just to much.
